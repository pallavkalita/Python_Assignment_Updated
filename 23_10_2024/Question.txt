Case Study : Banking Application
Problem:
A bank is developing an application where users can transfer funds between accounts. The program needs to handle various exceptions to prevent issues like transferring more money than the available balance, or entering an invalid account number.

Custom exception handling for:
	•	Insufficient Funds: Raised a custom exception when the transfer amount exceeds the balance.
	•	Invalid Account Number: Handled invalid account formats by catching a ValueError.
