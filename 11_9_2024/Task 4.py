"""
Problem 4: Planets and Distances
Create a function named list_planets() that returns the following list of planets: "Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars".

Create a function named distance_from_sun(planet) which receives a string argument representing a planet and returns its average distance from the Sun in millions of kilometers. For example, "Earth" should return "149.6 million km."

Call list_planets() and use distance_from_sun() to print statements about each planetâ€™s distance from the Sun, like "Earth is 149.6 million km away from the Sun."
